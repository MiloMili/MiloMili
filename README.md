I'm interested in design-oriented frontend development and am currently focusing on learning and mastering the basics of React.js. 

I'm highly motivated and take every opportunity to learn and enhance my skills and experience. As a junior with one project behind me (as seen on my profile), I'm more than happy to work with companies and individuals who believe and invest in their collaborators. I'm eager to learn and evolve in every aspect possible.  

For more information or interest in collaboration, don't hesitate to contact me via e-mail at: amiladuranovic082@gmail.com.
